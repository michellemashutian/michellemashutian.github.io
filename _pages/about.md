ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shutian! A researcher by day, code explorer by night, and a lifelong learner in between. I navigate the world of machine learning, NLP, and a bit of leetcode.  

<b>Yes! I'm open to new opportunities!</b> ðŸš€ I learn fast and adapt even faster. If you're looking for an NLP/machine learning engineer, letâ€™s connect! â˜•ðŸ’»

I was a NLP engineer at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/) for three years. Before that, I interned at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) and a now-defunct startup. I also did a short stint at [Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipment](https://www.leadintelligent.com/en/), on improving an industrial Q&A system.

I was a GenAI Language Annotation Specialist at Meta, contributing to Simplified Chinese LLM data annotation for [generative AI evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26601). I'm now with [Axon](https://www.axon.com/), focusing on audio LLM research and experiments, including audio data processing and model evaluation. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Information Science at [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/) under Prof. [Chengzhi Zhang](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/) in 2021 and was a visiting scholar at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) , advised by Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me/) and Prof. [Katy BÃ¶rner](https://cns-iu.github.io/katy/).
