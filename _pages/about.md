ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shutian! A researcher by day, code explorer by night, and a lifelong learner in between. I navigate the world of machine learning, NLP, and a bit of leetcode. Yes! I'm open to new opportunities! ðŸš€

I was a NLP engineer at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/) for three years. Before Tencent, I interned at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) and a now-defunct startup. Before moving to US, I did a short stint at [Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipment](https://www.leadintelligent.com/en/), helping improve an industry-focused AI system.

Now, I work as a freelance Academic Mentor at [Woen](https://appakl7qnoo1285.pc.xiaoe-tech.com/), AI Deployment & Media Specialist at [Fizzdragon](https://fizzdragon.com/). On the side, I mentor studentsâ€”one of them just submitted a short paper to ACL on LLM evaluation in scientific text summarization (fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž).

I received my Ph.D. degree in Information Science at [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/) under Prof. [Chengzhi Zhang](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/) in 2021. Besides, I was a visiting scholar at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) , advised by Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me/) and Prof. [Katy BÃ¶rner](https://cns-iu.github.io/katy/).

<b>What I Do Best</b>
I can handle classic NLP tasks (NER, text classification/clustering, sentiment analysis, knowledge graphs), build machine learning and deep learning models, and fine-tune LLMs. I also understand RAGâ€”while I donâ€™t have much hands-on experience with it yet, I learn fast and adapt even faster.

If you're looking for an NLP/machine learning engineer, or someone who can turn coffee into code, letâ€™s connect! â˜•ðŸ’»

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
